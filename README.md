The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code -- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death - Guido van Rossum

The ease of use and popularity, among others, is what attracts more and more developers to use the language - eventually leading to some amazing open-source projects.

ExchangeLib is one such well-featured Python module to connect with Microsoft Exchange via its EWS interface and performing mailing operation and also to get data insights on your emails.

One use case I could think of immediately are for the teams which manage all there support tickets via emails. This module can be used to get insights as to how many issues are being addressed over a given period.


The code in this repository presently does a simple mail counter. As a next step, I'm planning to have a complete package around this to give the statistics of the support tickets managed via mails. Please share your thoughts and other options that could be incorporated with this package
